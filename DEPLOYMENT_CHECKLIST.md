## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Deploy at https://share.streamlit.io/
3. Connect with WordPress via iframe integration

### Option 2: Traditional Hosting
- Requires VPS or Python-supporting host
- Hostinger VPS, DigitalOcean, or similar
- Custom domain setup required

## Production Configuration

### Required Files
- `app.py` - Main application
- `login.py` - Authentication system
- `utils/data_manager.py` - Data operations
- `utils/validators.py` - Input validation
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### Environment Settings
```bash
# Production login credentials
Username: whitesadmin
Password: WhitesFleet2025!
Session timeout: 24 hours
```

### Data Storage
- CSV files created automatically in `data/` directory
- No database setup required
- Automatic backup recommended

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Change Login Credentials**
   - Update login.py with secure credentials
   - Consider implementing user management

2. **Set Up Regular Backups**
   - Backup `data/` directory regularly
   - Consider cloud storage integration

3. **Monitor System Performance**
   - Check CSV file sizes as data grows
   - Monitor memory usage with large datasets

4. **User Training**
   - Provide documentation for custom categories
   - Explain Whites ID system usage
   - Train on export functionality

## Security Considerations

- Login system active with session timeout
- CSV files stored locally (no external database)
- No sensitive data exposure in URLs
- Form validation prevents invalid data entry

## Support Information

### System Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit 1.28.0+
- Pandas 2.0.0+
- Plotly 5.15.0+

### Known Limitations
- Single-user system (admin only)
- CSV-based storage (not suitable for high-volume concurrent users)
- No real-time collaboration features

### Maintenance
- Regular CSV file backups recommended
- Monitor file sizes as data grows
- Update dependencies periodically
