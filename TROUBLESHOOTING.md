# Fleet Management System - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. AttributeError: module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'switch_page'

**Problem**: You have an older version of Streamlit installed.

**Solution**:
```cmd
pip install --upgrade streamlit
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```cmd
pip uninstall streamlit
pip install streamlit>=1.28.0
```

**Alternative**: The application has been updated to work without this function. Simply use the sidebar navigation instead of the quick action buttons.

### 2. ImportError or ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem**: Required packages are not installed.

**Solution**:
1. Run `install_packages.bat` as Administrator
2. Or manually install:
```cmd
pip install streamlit>=1.28.0 pandas>=1.3.0 plotly>=5.0.0
```

### 3. Permission Denied Errors

**Problem**: Python cannot write to the data folder.

**Solutions**:
- Run the application as Administrator
- Check folder permissions for C:\FleetManagement
- Ensure antivirus is not blocking the application

### 4. Application Won't Start

**Problem**: Various startup issues.

**Check List**:
1. Python is installed: `python --version`
2. Packages are installed: Run `check_system.bat`
3. You're in the correct folder: `cd C:\FleetManagement`
4. Port 8501 is not in use by another application

**Solutions**:
- Close any other Streamlit applications
- Try a different port:
```cmd
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

### 5. Data Not Saving

**Problem**: CSV files are not being created or updated.

**Check**:
- Data folder exists in your FleetManagement directory
- You have write permissions
- Sufficient disk space available

**Solution**:
```cmd
mkdir data
```

### 6. Browser Not Opening Automatically

**Problem**: Streamlit starts but browser doesn't open.

**Solution**:
- Manually navigate to: http://localhost:8501
- Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check Windows Firewall settings

### 7. Charts Not Displaying

**Problem**: Plotly charts show as blank or error.

**Solution**:
```cmd
pip install --upgrade plotly
```

### 8. Python Not Found

**Problem**: 'python' is not recognized as a command.

**Solution**:
1. Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
2. Or add Python to PATH manually:
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Add Python installation path to PATH variable
   - Restart Command Prompt

### 9. Older Streamlit Compatibility

**Problem**: You're using an older Streamlit version and getting errors.

**Workaround**:
The application has been updated to be compatible with older versions. Navigation buttons will show information messages instead of switching pages directly.

**Navigation**: Use the sidebar menu to navigate between pages:
- üè† Main Dashboard
- üöó Vehicle Inventory  
- üîß Maintenance Records
- üìä Dashboard
- üîß Tool Hire

### 10. Company Firewall Issues

**Problem**: Packages won't install due to corporate firewall.

**Solutions**:
1. Ask IT department to whitelist PyPI (pypi.org)
2. Download packages manually and install offline
3. Use company's internal package repository if available

### 11. Windows Defender/Antivirus Blocking

**Problem**: Antivirus software blocks the application.

**Solutions**:
- Add FleetManagement folder to antivirus exclusions
- Temporarily disable real-time protection during installation
- Run from a different location (Desktop, Documents)

## Quick Fixes

### Reset Everything
If you encounter multiple issues:

1. Delete the entire FleetManagement folder
2. Create a new C:\FleetManagement folder
3. Copy all files again
4. Run `install_packages.bat` as Administrator
5. Run `check_system.bat` to verify
6. Run `start_app.bat`

### Manual Start
If batch files don't work:

```cmd
cd C:\FleetManagement
python -m streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

### Check Installation
Verify your setup:

```cmd
python --version
pip list | findstr streamlit
pip list | findstr pandas
pip list | findstr plotly
```

## Getting Help

1. Run `check_system.bat` and note any error messages
